### questions
### Algorithms
* **Binary Tree Traversal**
* How would you handle processing large datasets in a  constrained environment?
* Split array apart into two equal sums.  
* read csv files, array operation  
* Tell me about the most challenging project of yours.
* Convert a sentence to goat latin which has been mentioned a lot by others
* count the pair of elements in an integer array based on some selection constraints.
* Math-based coding questions with no possible real-life application
* standard coding and systems/linux questions
* Given a list of words, create a master list that has sublists that contain anagrams
* Simple comparison between numbers given constraints see how many comparisons are true.
* Import a CSV / JSON file. If condition is met, print two attributes for that condition.
* Add each number in an array until the sum equals the rest of the array
* Their coding interview is not crazy, it is focussed on **performance and efficiency** :sparkling_heart: (please be thorough with complexity analysis
* With very little detailed information, how would you approach tackling a performance problem in a web application (i.e., step through your thought process of what steps you would take, information you would seek, etc.).
* coding - counting things in a logfile, basic algorithms
* Problem with many formulas to get speed of different animals based on the number of legs. Information comes from 2 different files. Process the info and display animals from fastest to slowest
* **when you saw many system interrupts, what could be the possible reason in linux**
  - many IOs
  - page faults
  - incoming network packet
### System
* Systems internals, **vmstat, netcat** :fire: :boom:, shell scripting  
* If you're not a recent CS grad, the systems questions are probably going to end your interview- they basically expect that you've taken an Operating Systems course within the last few years
* Given output of command **vmstat and analyze the system** :fire: :punch: :revolving_hearts:
* Send packets to remote machines and try to upgrade the packet remotely.
* Troubleshooting why some of the machines are not updated.  
* Know the kernel in incredible depth
* "systems interview", but it's extremely low level. **Swap management, server flags, process management**.:hibiscus: A recommendation for a book called **"The Linux Programming Interface"**
  1. What part of the tcp header does traceroute modify?  
  2. How do you make a process a service?  
  3. What is a zombie process?  
  4. Something about the kernel. I don't recall details.
* Linux kernel, Network deep dive, distributed system design  
* **What happens during the boot process from the moment you turn on the machine until you get a login prompt?**:four_leaf_clover:
* Pick up a Linux Kernel book.... (own it.)........ and have an Overview of Performance related commands( Truth --- >> know each parameter( if it changes(increase/decrease) and how it affects performance( This is where i failed)
* Study the Entire Linux kernel and Performance related commands for 10-15 days before the interview.
* Try to understand how web farms(servers) are maintained.
* Expect some very vague problem statements( troubleshooting question)
* Be ready for a set of large scale (Web scale)
* Linux Performance commands..... ( Well the engineer spent ...15 mins on one command.
* Know Kernel to the CPU interrupt level
* Name three states a process can be in.
  - Halt, running, terminated
* Where is the dns file located?  
* What signal do you send a service to end it?
* What is the type of record that resolves urls to ip records?
* Under ps, what are three states that a service can be in?  
  - Sl for sleeping, Z for zombie, and I guessed R probably for running, but I rarely work with good states.
* Out of the 5-6 states you can find under ps, which two takes up system memory?  
  - I guessed running and sleeping, but they said running and iowait was the right answer. I'm not too sure they're right on this one though, as I've definitely troubleshot sleeping services that were using excessive memory but configured poorly.
* If 0 is STDIN and 1 is STDOUT, what's 2
  - STDERR
*  Know TCP/IP, BigO, kernel internals, etc. Try to think at big scale.  
* What is the default signal that is generated when sending a kill command to a process in Linux?
  - sigterm
  - 15 or SIGTERM (terminate the process)
  - SIGTERM : kill process gracefully means it allows process to save current state configurations or avoid
SIGKILL : kill process or process group immediatel
* The questions were ridiculous, down to how certain flag options affect the output of certain commands.
* what happens when you typed 'ls' in the terminal.  
  - your shell process forks and waits on son's process to finish. The son process execv's /bin/ls (with parameters you sent), run, and returns output to same output as of the shell's process output - usually the screen unless used an output redirection.
* KNOW your basic troubleshooting tools, linux command line, filesystem(for unix/linux based, like what goes where, knowing this will help for some sort of troubleshooting)
* Also try to solve questions like what to do when some is wrong type of questions. scoutapp's articles for tools was helpful for knowing some troubleshooting.
* NDA
* I signed an NDA, so I can't give my questions, but REALLY know your linux OS fundamentals (from high level concepts such as launching an executable to low level concepts like the different implementations of virtual memory). CareerCup and the Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook by Evi Nemeth were invaluable
* What will happen when type "ls -l *.txt


### System based coding
* Coding, design, Linux, Network and soft skills.


### Networking
* In IPv6 what is the A record equivalent?  
* super basic, whats your favorite protocol. questions about DNS
* Common port names for different networking services.
* HTTP port = HTTPs Port = DNS port = SSH Port = 22 FTP = 21, HTTP =80
HTTPS - 443 FTP
 DNS - 53
Telnet = 23
SSH= 22
* Port number for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS
### Behavioural
* TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF"
